1) QUICK BACKGROUND
====================================================================================
*	This project includes two programs, suncrypt and sundec. Encryption is carried
	out by suncrypt, while decryption is carried out by sundec

*	The project is written in C++, and must be compiled with GNU GCC g++

*	The project involves utilizing libgcrypt to perform cryptographic functions

*	Both accept a <file> input, followed by a <-l> or <-d> for the mode. 
	Local mode, <-l> encrypts a file and writes the output file to a file with the 
	input file name appended by ".uf" in suncrypt, and decrypts a file that is 
	assumed to have the ".uf" extension and outputs to a file with the input name 
	without the extension in sundec. Daemon, or network, mode -d, performs the same 
	operations, but the	output file of suncrypt is sent over the network to sundec 
	running	at the input <IPaddress:port>, where sundec is awaiting the arrival 
	of the file on <port>
